Dear tiney community members,

Like many of you, we have been heartbroken by the murder of George Floyd in America and the general feeling of powerlessness that so many in that country and around the world feel during the current crisis.

At tiney, we are working to build a community that operates in the spirit of social justice through supporting small entrepreneurs in starting and running successful businesses and ensuring all children have access to outstanding education and care at the youngest ages where it can have the greatest impact. 

We would like to invite you to a discussion forum next Wednesday, 10th June at 4pm on Zoom, to talk about what we are feeling and give a space for community members to share ideas and thoughts on how tiney can build a community that delivers on this promise.

Best wishes,
Brett

Good morning  everyone. Just wondering  if you also having the same problem as me. On the checks when i click on them they dont seem to work but the form i have to print and sign works. The others seem to be frozen is that because i have done them already or they have a problem. Am confused. I seem to have already done them i think its the same ones i filled in before.
